1. Introduction
1.1 Background

Plastic mismanagement has been recognised as a dominant issue that needs to be solved for global protection. Since the rapid increase in plastic production since 1950 and its waste, this planet is highly likely to be polluted with plastic. Annual plastic production was 40 billion in 2020, and the prediction indicates that approximately 120 billion plastic will be produced in 2060. Most disposal plastics, such as plastic bags and packages, have been classified as landfilled, as the data shows; the landfill rate is the highest globally among the plastic waste categories of landfill, recycling, incineration and mismanagement. Besides recycling, plastics likely transform into microplastics or toxic chemicals in various ways and pollute the environment. For example, incineration pollutes the air, mismanagement damages marine life, and landfills intoxicate the soil, which destroys the ecosystem. 
 Not only plastic bags and bottles of water but also clothes and electronic devices do we use plastic materials. As the prevailing lifestyle is an overreliance on plastic, it is pivotal to reduce mismanagement and minimise plastic consumption by proper recycling or refraining from disposing of plastic items. 

1.2 Objectives

The research about correlations between education and economic growth revealed significant [1]. The richer the countries become, the more money the government dedicates to education. When people are educated and skilled, the chance of obtaining an occupation with a higher salary is raised. Subsequently, more money was used to promote economic growth.  This trend could be observed not only at the societal level but also at the individual level. The higher GDP per capita countries showed this tendency for more citizens to spend on education for postsecondary school in developing countries like Luxemburg [2].
 However, economic growth does not always correlate to significant practical plastic waste management changes. Despite the fact that GDP growth is upward in all region and their considerable growth,  some regions show distinctive trends, notably the world-leading country, the USA. Its GDP score was 10 to 21 trillion between 2000 and 2020, the highest economic growth. Yet, no significant improvement in plastic waste management was observed, although the quality of education(goal 4 in SDG) was maintained at over 90%. In contrast, China ranked 2nd largest economic growth country, experienced rapid growth from 1.2 to 14 trillion with a constant quality education rate of 97%, dramatically improving plastic waste management in mismanagement. India, the country with the third highest GDP, followed this trend in plastic waste mismanagement on a smaller scale in terms of GDP from 0.4 to 2 trillion and a gradual increase in quality education from 60 to 80%. These two Asian countries showed similar trends in plastic management and population, although their GDP scores were at different levels. Conversely, maintaining a higher level of education in Europe reflected the improvement in landfill management, although the GDP level is much lower than in India.
This correlational study aims to reveal how much education and economic growth impact plastic management change by region.  Since each continent and country has different features from heterogeneous perspectives, it is noteworthy to detect the discrepancy between developed countries so that this country can be a model to solve the ongoing stagnation and enable other countries to achieve the SDGS goal effectively [3]. Based on these results, the potential casualties of plastic management rate changes, such as education curricula, regulation of garbage collection, policy and politics will be discussed.


1.3 Research Question
The research question is: "How do different parts of society influence plastic waste management, and where can we see correlations in plastic management improvement by comparing the education and economic growth rate?". To explore which country or continent has unique characteristics contributing to plastic management, this correlational research was done by using the score of Quality education (Goal 4) and Decent work and economic growth (Goal 8) from the dataset of SDGs from the United Nations. Classifying the world by continent and world-leading countries in GDP - USA, China and India. Also, the potential causality is discussed accordingly. 


2. Theoretical Framework

Previous research on the correlations between economic growth and quality education revealed positive results. Regarding sustainability study,“ (...) 1% increase in individual environmental knowledge leads to a 0.4% increase in environmental behaviour among university students through model estimation.”[4].  Based on this perspective, the correlation between Goal 4 and Goal 8 in SDGS has a theoretically positive correlation with plastic management improvement. However, as Makarenko.I. et al., 2021 indicated, “(...)there is no “correct” way to assess the level of achievement of sustainable development goals”, and integrating higher education is needed for SDG 4 implementation [5]. Nevertheless, they also concluded that education is the basis of economic growth as it provides a “knowledge-based economy”[6]. Based on this research result, the strong correlation between education and economic growth is regarded as a knowledge-based economy that results in sustainable economic and education development.
 This research employed Spearman’s Correlation Coefficient (ρ)  mainly because of the previous research about the SDG score conducted by Pakkan. S. et al. 2022 stated that “Spearman’s Correlation Coefficient (ρ) provides a measure to evaluate the strength of an association between two variables” and “can capture the nonlinear correlation between the variables and is less sensitive to outliers. Spearman’s analysis is widely used to identify general relations beyond the linear correlation between two variables in various disciplines (Spearman 1987) ”[7].


3. Methodology
3.1 Data Collection
The primary dataset of SDGs and plastic management was cited from Kaggle. The SDG database is the same one as the prototype listed on the United Nations’ website. 
This research aimed to observe three correlations of education, economic growth, and plastic management, and the number of datasets used was minimised to avoid measurement error. Secondly, the countries that match the countries listed in the plastic waste data were extracted to merge the plastic management and SDG datasets. The sample size of countries extracted was approximately 70 % of those listed in the SDG data (N = 195, n = 140).
SDG and plastic management datasets were tested to clarify their distribution. The data from goal 4 and goal 8 and plastic waste management employed skewness and kurtosis analysis and Shapiro-Wilk and KS tests. Both values for Goal 4 and Goal 8 are skewed, although Goal 4 is significantly negatively skewed, while Goal 8 is almost normally distributed but still skewed. Also, plastic management data in 4 categories are skewed considerably. As all the distribution is skewed, the Spearman correlation is mainly employed in this research. Due to the outliers and smaller size continents such as Oceania(n = 12),  Kendall Tau is also applied for the regional research. Moreover,  Fischer's z-transformation was applied to the Spearman correlation of Goal 4 and plastic managers and Goal 8 and plastic management. All the data was visualised individually in line graphs and heatmaps, respectively, and a biplot was employed to visualise the tendency in one place.
